# ETL-Project-
This project demonstrates skills in web scraping, data integration, API usage, and data analysis using Python and Pandas.
Proof-of-Concept Questions
1.	Living Space Statistics by Bedrooms: 
o	Calculate the mean and standard deviation of sqft_living grouped by the number of bedrooms.
2.	Authors on Large Lots: 
o	Identify authors (by gender) whose lot size (sqft_lot) exceeds the mean + 1 standard deviation of the lot size for their bedroom group.
3.	Price Categories: 
o	Use pd.cut() to divide the price column into 3 bins labeled low, medium, and high.
o	Count the number of authors in each price category.
 
Deliverables
•	A Jupyter Notebook (JNB) containing: 
o	The final integrated DataFrame.
o	Solutions to the proof-of-concept questions.
•	Ensure the notebook is free of circular dependencies by clearing outputs, restarting the kernel, and re-running all cells before submission.
